# Developing-Soft-and-Parallel-Programming-Skills-Using-Project-Based-Learning
Computer architecture group projects and reports that demonstrate skills in time managment, team work, and problem solving. 

Project_1:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project reviews team work basic that include expectations from team members and how to properly communicate with teammates. This project also includes Raspberry PI software installation and simple assembly programming

Project_2:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, my team identify the architecture of the Raspberry PI B+ and analyze the difference of parrallel and sequential programming. My team is introduced to parallel programming basic using openMP and utilizing forks. ARM program is including, which add values together and stores them to registers.

Project_3:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project my team research more team work basic such as parrallel programing task, instructions and models. My team uses OpenMP to write a program that allows for loops to be divided into equal parts and distrubutes them to threads inorder for each thread to execute different iterations. We also write another artithmatic ARM program.

Project_4:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this point, my team explores more advance topics in parall programming. We gain understanding of race condition , dependencies, and synchronization. In the parallel programming portion, we observe the differences when a parallel program executes with diffrent #pragma omp inclusions.

Project_5:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our final project project takes everything we have learn up to this point and gives us a real world example of a program that benifits from parallel programming. We write and compile code that designs pharmaceutical drugs by taking proteins and tries to match ligands. My team investigates the difference OpenMP, MPI, and MapReduce and learn the appropriate time to use them.
